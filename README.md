# IWXXM Translation Suite
A repository of examples of TAC and IWXXM messages that are equivalent. As a body these examples represent the set of IWXXM and TAC messages that a tool must be able to translate exactly to be fully IWXXM-compliant, with the exception of newlines which may be different.

Messages are provided for each amendment of ICAO Annex 3, as both the TAC and IWXXM contents may change during each amendment.  For every ".tac" file there should be an equivalent ".xml" file with the same name, and vice versa.  

Note that this repository is not yet official and has been set up for testing and evaluation purposes.

# Contributing
Pull requests with additional cases are both welcomed and encouraged.  File names should indicate the unique aspects of the message.  New cases will be reviewed prior to acceptance into the main branch for validity and translation correctness.
